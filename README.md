Term deposits are a major sourceof income for a bank.
A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term.

The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to theircustomers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing
and digital marketing.

Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way
to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call
centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial
to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can
be specifically targeted via call.

With Clients data such as: age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. Along with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. Given this information, a MODEL is built to predict that the client will subscribe to term deposit.
